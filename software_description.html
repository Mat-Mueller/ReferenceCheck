        <h4>1. What is this software, and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>This software helps users ensure the accuracy of citations in their PDF documents. By analyzing both in-text citations and the reference list, it checks for consistency between them, verifying that each citation in the text appears in the reference list and vice versa. Additionally, it accesses the CrossRef database to verify the validity of each reference, and users can also perform a Google Scholar search for references to ensure accuracy and find relevant publications.</p>

        <h4>2. How do I use it?</h4>
        <p>Simply upload your PDF document here, and the software will guide you through adjusting settings for citation and reference verification. After the analysis is complete, you’ll see an overview of any mismatched in-text citations and references, along with an unformatted version of your document in plain text, which may help with manual verification if needed.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Entry 4 -->
    <div class="result-frame" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        <h4>4. What is the level of accuracy, and what happens if there’s a mismatch between in-text citations and the reference list?</h4>
        <p>While we strive for high accuracy, we cannot guarantee 100% precision, as there is always a chance of mismatches due to limitations in analyzing PDF text and detecting citations and references. If the software detects a mismatch, it will highlight the discrepancy, allowing the user to manually verify and match in-text citations and references.</p>
