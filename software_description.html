        <h4>1. What is this software, and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>This software helps users ensure the accuracy of citations in their PDF documents (see 3. for supported reference styles).
            By analyzing both in-text citations and the reference list, it checks for consistency between them, verifying that each
            citation in the text appears in the reference list and vice versa. Additionally, it accesses the CrossRef database to
            verify the validity of each reference, and users can also perform a Google Scholar search for references to ensure accuracy
            and find relevant publications.</p>

    <div class="result-frame" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        <h4>2. How do I use the software?</h4>
        <p>Simply upload your PDF document here, and the software will guide you through adjusting settings for citation and reference
            verification. After the analysis is complete, you’ll see an overview of any mismatched in-text citations and references in
            your document.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Entry 3 -->
    <div class="result-frame" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        <h4>3. What reference style is supported?</h4>
        <p>Currently, our software is designed to detect citations and references following the APA style.
            <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about APA style</a>. The results for matching in-text citations
            and reference section are not reliable for other reference styles. Matching may work for other reference styles similar to APA.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Entry 4 -->
    <div class="result-frame" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        <h4>4. What is the level of accuracy, and what happens if there’s a mismatch between the in-text citations and the reference list?</h4>
        <p>While we strive for high accuracy, we cannot guarantee 100% precision, as there is always a chance of mismatches due to limitations
            in analyzing PDF text and detecting citations and references. If the software detects a mismatch, it will highlight the discrepancy,
            allowing the user to manually verify and match in-text citations and references.</p>
